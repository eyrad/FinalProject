   	 <p>Our Mission is to equip smallholder farmers with the tools they need to achieve food security and income generation, which will spur economic development by creating jobs within the agricultural value chain and off the farm, with the ultimate goal of enabling poor people to participate in a robust marketplace.</p>

   	 <p>Through empowering individuals at the grassroot levels in the various communities it operates in, KAMMEY Solutions, Inc. works towards reducing global hunger by means of integrated livestock-crop agriculture. Communities involved in the agricultural activities will also be supported in managing their health and environment through education and service provision strategies in sustainable institutions.</p>

   		</div>   

   		<p>Africa has diversity in agricultural systems. In the subsistence system, livestock are kept as security for food and wealth in times of dire need. In the Pastoral or Landless (Nomadic) system a mixed herd of livestock (usually cattle, sheep and goats) are kept and moved from location to location in search of grazing pastures. Upon arrival in sedentary crop farming areas, they lived symbiotically with the crop farmers. After crops are harvested, pastoralists graze their livestock on the stubbles, while livestock (droppings) fertilize the land for the crop farmers for the next planting. Such collaborative partnerships are not without problems but may work beneficially when controlled.</p>

        <p>Community-based farming system is where, anywhere from five to ten households are brought together and trained to manage their subsistence livestock-crop farms. Within a community individuals would visit each other’s farms to see if what they were taught were being practiced. They would serve as their own critics. Quarterly or bimonthly, several communities would gather together to “show and tell”. In the out-grower scheme the smallholder provides land and labor in return for a comprehensive outreach-input package. Inputs in the production process, such as credits, tillage, spraying and harvesting are provided. These systems when properly controlled and managed would work well to secure food for Africa. This is where KAMMEY Solutions, Inc., will use variations of these farming systems to teach people in Africa how to get out of poverty.</p>
